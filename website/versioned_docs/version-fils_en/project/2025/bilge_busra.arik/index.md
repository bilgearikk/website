## Description

This project implements a Wi-Fi-enabled motion sensor system that detects movement using a PIR sensor and sends real-time alerts via HTTP. The system is designed using Raspberry Pi Pico W and written in Rust. It aims to provide a lightweight, low-cost, and portable security device that can be used in homes, offices, or academic settings.

Features include:
- PIR-based motion detection
- Wi-Fi connectivity using the `esp-wifi` crate
- HTTP-based notifications using `ureq` or `IFTTT`
- Optional LED or buzzer for local feedback
- Compact and battery-friendly design

---

## Motivation

This project was inspired by a need for simple, cost-effective IoT-based security solutions that can be built by students using modern embedded technologies. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with embedded Rust programming, microcontroller networking, and real-time system design.

---

## Architecture

The architecture includes:
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects motion via infrared radiation changes.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**: Processes the sensor input and handles Wi-Fi.
- **Rust firmware**: Handles networking, event logic, and notifications.
- **Cloud integration**: Sends HTTP alerts to a webhook or service like IFTTT.

### System Flow:
1. System powers on, connects to Wi-Fi.
2. PIR sensor detects motion.
3. Wi-Fi module triggers an HTTP POST request.
4. Alert is sent to predefined server or mobile notification.
